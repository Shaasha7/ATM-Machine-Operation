# ATM-Machine-Operation
This project simulates the working of an ATM. The user can select options from the menu to  check balance, deposit money, withdraw money or exit. The balance gets updated after each  transaction. 
# 🏧 ATM Simulation Program (Python)

This project is a **console-based ATM simulation program** developed using **Python**.  
It allows the user to check balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and exit the system using a menu-driven approach.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The program starts with an initial balance and continuously displays an ATM menu until the user chooses to exit.

### Available Options:
1. Check account balance  
2. Deposit money  
3. Withdraw money  
4. Exit the ATM system  

The program validates withdrawals to ensure sufficient balance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- Concepts used:
  - Variables
  - `while` loop
  - Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
  - User input using `input()`
  - Basic arithmetic operations

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Program

1. Make sure **Python 3** is installed on your system
2. Download or clone this repository
3. Open terminal / command prompt
4. Run the program using:

```bash
python atm.py
🧠 How the Program Works
Initial balance is set to ₹5000

Menu is displayed repeatedly using a while True loop

Deposit adds money to balance

Withdraw subtracts money only if sufficient balance is available

Program exits when user selects option 4

📊 Sample Output

1. Check Balance
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Your Balance = Rs. 5000
